//

src folder : used for storing packages
package : used for storing java files
package names is lowercase
File (class) names Uppercase
Name must CamelCase


java file :
right click Package -> new-> Java class
Class create inside the package


Formatting the codes :
Mac: command  + option + L
or go to the help find action write  code format



public static void main ====== main  +main
println ================= sout + enter

copy paste your  snippet code :

``` code ```
3 print statements :

print() Method
println() Method
printf() Method

out changes err is red write

println after printing the last character , appends a new line
print after printing the last character , does not appends new line

// we have to use // when we write note in comment in single line

/*  comment */ this is for multi line comment


\n new line
\t tab: it is leave a gap like tab
\\ two backslash : it prints one \
\" print "
\ backslash : for write character \" vs... you write before character ( \" and \\)
LiKE \"Hello\"



Java Data Types

Primitive : integer ( short , byte, int, long )
            Float Point Number ( double,  float )
            Characters ( char )
            Boolean (boolean)

Non Primitve :  String
                Array
                Classes
                Etc

DataType VariablesName = Variables

byte = -128 to 127
short = -32,768 to 32,767
int = 2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
long =
double =
char = use for only single character
boolean = true false


we use for _ for separate the digits like = 100_000_000
if you use , for separate the digits intellij give compiler error
we have to use L after number long x = 99999999999L


decimal number use float or double
float use F after numbers

double > float > long > int > short >byte

integer you will use int for decimal you will use double

double quote use for text for variable you can not use double quote for variables

int = for all integers
double = for decimals
char = for single characters
boolean = true / false

String =  is a sequence of characters, surrounded by double quote ( “” )


Variables names should be readable
• When variable names contain two or more words, use camel case
• The first character must be one of the letters a-z or A-Z,an underscore(_),ora dollar sign ( $ )
• After the first character, you may use letters a - z or A - Z, the digits, underscore ( _ ) or dollar sign ( $ )
• Can Not include spaces
• Variable names can not be Java reserved word



HOw to Replace variable names ?

1. Control + R
2. old variable name
3. new variable name
4. replace all

Addition = +

number + number ===> Addition

concatenation = + must one string left or right

string + data ===> concatenation
data + string ====> concatenation
string + string =====> concatenation


use comma for continue if you use semicolon close primitives

every escape sequences in double quote

implicit and explicint casting


int number ;
double dval = 32.33;
int number = (int)dval;
(int) want to convert

+ = addition
- = subtract
* = multiplication
/ = division
% = Remainder


10/4 = 2 because this is integer

d convert to decimal 100d = 100.0
